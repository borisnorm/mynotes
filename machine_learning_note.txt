[k Meaning Clustering]
Two steps:
1. Cluster assignment step
2. Move centroid step
* If any cluster centroid has zero data points/examples assigned to it, just eliminate that class centroid.
* Recommend Initialization Method: Randomly pick k points as the initial k cluster centroids.
* To avoid local optima, do multiple random initialization (normally 50 - 100).
