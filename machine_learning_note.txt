[k Meaning Clustering]
Two steps:
1. Cluster assignment step
2. Move centroid step

* If any cluster centroid has zero data points/examples assigned to it, just eliminate that class centroid.

* Recommend Initialization Method: Randomly pick k points as the initial k cluster centroids.

* To avoid local optima, do multiple random initializations, normally 50 - 100 iterations. When k is 2 - 10, this method works best. For large k, for example several hundreds, multiple random initialization does not helps a lot. Probably the first initialization gives a solution, which can not be improved much in additional random initializations any more.

[Supervised Learning]
Two types: 1) Regression, 2) Classification
