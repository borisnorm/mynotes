* Paging
	One of the memory management schemes by which a computer stores and retrieves data from the secondary storage for use in main memory.
	An important part of virtual memory implementation.

* Virtual memory:  a memory management technique maps memory addresses used by a program, called virtual addresses, into physical addresses in computer memory.

* Context switch: a context switch is the process of storing and restoring the state (more specifically, the context) of a process or thread so that execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time. 

* Interrupt: a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. 
	Hardware interrupt: used by devices to communicate that they require attention from the operating system.
	Software interrupt: caused either by an exceptional condition in the processor itself, or a special instruction in the instruction set which causes an interrupt when it is executed.

* System call: how a program requests a service from an operating system's kernel.
