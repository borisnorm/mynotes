	## Integration testing
	* Any type of software testing that seeks to verify the interfaces between components against a software design.
	* The phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. 
	* Occurs after unit testing and before validation testing.
	* Progressively larger groups of tested software components corresponding to elements of the architectural design are integrated and tested until the software works as a system.
